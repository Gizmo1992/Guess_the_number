# Guess_the_number
It's a simple number guessing game, where you need to guess the right number between 1 and 100.
This was a project in a Udemy course(TOTAL Python: Become an Andvanced Python developer in 16 days) where I manged to complete this without watching the solution. It takes the user name as an input, then it generates a random integer between 1 and 100 where the user has to guess it, before it runs out of tries. It tracks how many tries the user has left and It display that the most recent guess was either too low or too high.
